## Workflow Board Design

This project was developed with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).

A simple workflow board that demonstrates the usage of CSS-in-JS using reusable styled components. Design inspirations are based on an image I found somewhere on the internet, and the data is available in <code>./constants.js</code>. All base components including <code>div</code> containers are created under base-components directory.
Use <code> yarn start</code> to run.
